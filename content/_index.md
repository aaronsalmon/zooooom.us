## Backstory

Long ago in a land far far away the people of earth were able to leave their houses. They had meetings that were in person and did not have to do every social interaction over a video conference. 

Today, that world is dead. We now live in a video conference sort of world. To make sure that we fully engage our new world, we made this screensaver. It will make sure that even when you are not using your computer, it will be participating in our new world with full compliance. 

## Contribute

The easiest thing you can do is submit yourself acting like you are on the world's best video conference [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScbT9qiRUxeM8WfiP2aWF13HENLJffiTgD8GOd9t8W9nmyVHQ/viewform)

You can also take a gander at the project and help us make it better on [github](https://github.com/harperreed/zooooom.us).

## Thanks
