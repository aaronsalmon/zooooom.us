## Update 

### We launched V.1.1 `Tru Biz` 

In collaboration with [Christine Sun Kim](http://asl.wtf) we launched the newest version of the zooooom.us screensaver. This time with some new features, a bunch of participants and a new audience. 

From Christine: 

> Video chat has always been part of Deaf people's lives, way before covid started, and as you can imagine, “zoom fatigue” doesn’t exist for us. After seeing Harper and Toler’s black mirror-ish zoom, I immediately asked them about doing a Deaf version. Basically, we have our own listening faces with no earpods or headphones, and sometimes we slightly mimic the speaker’s moving face to show that we’re listening. 
>     
> So I asked 20 of my Deaf friends to participate and now other Deaf people can download the project and have Deaf faces stare back at them.
>      
> After you’ve downloaded the screensaver, you can either select “everyone” or “Deaf only”.

As always, you can download the newest version [here](/download)

## Backstory

Long ago in a land far far away the people of earth were able to leave their houses. They had meetings that were in person and did not have to do every social interaction over a video conference.

Today, that world is dead. We now live in a video conference sort of world. To make sure that we fully engage our new world, we made this screensaver. It will make sure that even when you are not using your computer, it will be participating in our new world with full compliance.
